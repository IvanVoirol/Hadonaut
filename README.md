# Hadonaut

Hadonaut is a spatial adventure game made with Godot, it is still in early development, any kind of feedback is much appreciated!

After you wake up out of a cryogenic pod, you find yourself in a dark room, space unfolding behind the windows...

The concept of the game is to rely as much as possible on gameplay, without the help of tutorials or explanatory texts.
